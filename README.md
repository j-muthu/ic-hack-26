## Voice Cloning

Clone a voice and hear motivational messages spoken in that voice:

1. Send `/clone` to the bot
2. Record and send a 15-30 second voice message - this can be:
   - **Your own voice** - hear encouragement from your future self
   - **A friend or family member** - hear support from someone who cares about you
3. Wait for confirmation that the voice was cloned
4. Use `/personal` anytime to hear an encouraging message in that voice

### Custom Messages

Add any request after `/personal` to get a personalized response:

- `/personal encourage me with religious scripture`
- `/personal remind me why I started this journey`
- `/personal help me get through this craving`
- `/personal tell me I can do this`

The cloned voice will respond to whatever you ask.
